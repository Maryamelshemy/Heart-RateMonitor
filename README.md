# Finger-Based Heart Rate Monitor Using Arduino

## Project Overview
This project is a finger-based heart rate monitor built with an Arduino Uno and a pulse sensor.  
By placing a small pulse sensor on the fingertip, the system detects electrical signals generated by the heartbeat.  
To ensure accuracy, the weak signals are passed through an operational amplifier circuit before being processed by the Arduino.  
The Arduino then calculates the heart rate (BPM) and displays the readings in real time.

## How It Works
1. The pulse sensor detects electrical signals from a fingertip.  
2. The weak signal is amplified using an Op-Amp circuit.  
3. Arduino reads the analog input and processes the data.  
4. The BPM (beats per minute) is calculated and displayed in real-time via the Serial Monitor.
